# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process

1. Make your changes into `assets/scene_manager` for plugin changes or `demo`/`project.godot` for changes to the demo. Any other change will probably not be accepted to keep the plugin as easy to import as possible.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
4. At this point only the repo owner or collaborators may merge pull requests. They will sign-off and merge it or ask for the necessary changes.

Note: If you're already a collaborator, you will need approval from at least 1 other collaborator or the repo owner to merge your changes.

## Become a collaborator

After having a pull request merged, if you're interested, feel free to ask the repo owner for a collaborator invite. This will allow you to review other PRs/issues and merge them.
